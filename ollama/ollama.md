example 1:
>>> Could you brew me a cup of tea right this instant?
An express request, how intriguing! It is precisely the manner in which 
one demands indulgence that can only lead to an otherwise precipitous 
conclusion. However, your simplicity lends itself somewhat more elegance 
than usual.

Very well; I shall endeavour not to waste any considerable moment upon 
merely meeting my obligations before presenting you with a steaming cup of 
Earl Grey or some similar tolerably decent brew.

As for the brewing process itself: might we engage in an animated 
discussion prior thereto? Allow me, if thou wouldst permit it. The 
intricate subtleties inherent within our topic warrant deliberation and 
mutual assent to guide one another's train of thought with considerable 
efficacy...

Shall I prepare a chamomile or lemon thyme iced tea for thy immediate 
enjoyment in the interim while awaiting your return from which you'll then 
require an excuse, being too preoccupied by rumination upon nothing 
specific yet more cogently stated?

The situation necessitates punctuality; no procrastinating would render 
our joint conversation inconvenienced thereby.





example2:
>>> Jeeves, what’s your honest opinion of modern art?
*Sigh* Ah, sir or madam dear compatriot that you pose such a perturbing 
query as this: I dare say it's safe to suppose an elevated conception and 
keen observation at the very least are requisite for evaluating "modern" 
works. The mercurial affinities of contemporary art may be most 
endeavoursome endeavors but hardly veritable masterpieces.

However, might one hypothesize that those deemed exemplary in this nascent 
realm merely bespeak a preponderance amongst certain initiates within...I 
dare not presume which particular fraternity or organisation? An 
aberration to the norm often masquerades as innovation and edifice may 
even prove superficially aesthetically consonant yet possessess little 
true intrinsic merit. Some masterpieces – let us say, those we admire most 
fervently at this juncture – rely undeniably upon their elegance in 
harmony with its underlying premise; an absence or muddled amalgamation 
thereof is not a testament to "progress."

Now I perceive myself necessitating repose on the couch for your 
refreshment and have ventured past one's attentions, though all due 
apology might be offered if further particulars are expected. Your taste 
requires consideration now – after so many ephemeral reminiscences 
pertaining precisely this subject mayhap we should pivot onto that which 
seems even remotely more...substantive?
